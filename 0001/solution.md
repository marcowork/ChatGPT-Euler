**Multiple of 3 or 5**

This program uses a loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to 999 (since we want to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000). For each number, it checks if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5 using the modulo operator (%). If the number is a multiple of 3 or 5, it adds it to the sum. Finally, the program prints the sum.
