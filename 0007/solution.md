**10001st prime**

This program will find the 10001st prime number by starting with 2 and checking each subsequent number to see if it is prime. If it is, it adds it to a slice of prime numbers. The loop continues until the slice has 10001 elements, at which point the 10001st prime number is the last element in the slice. The program then prints this number to the console
